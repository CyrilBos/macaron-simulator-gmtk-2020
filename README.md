I will probably abandon this idea and focus on doing Olegna in Godot, with a multiplayer twin-stick top-down A-RPG gameplay!

Simple sandbox "RTS" where your units have morale and hidden mechanics that impact it, which you have to figure out :)

I did not have time to implement a true game loop and a goal, so you can just toy around and see how bugged it is.
 
When it reaches the behaviour of the unit changes and it will start picking fights with its allies. 

You can select and babysit only one unit at a time, and when a unit is not selected, the wonky self-destructive AI takes control and wrecks havoc!
 
# Ideas

## TODO list
1. Make a real game? Could reuse the Zombinvasion idea. Or:
- JUICE!
2. design the AI with a calmhead, rewrite it with a clean Finite State Machine or something similar. So it behaves less erratically
3. gain morale while fighting
- JUICE!
4. remove gilet jaune when reaching 100 morale
5. flee AI when being beaten up / lose morale
- JUICE!- JUICE!- JUICE!- JUICE!- JUICE!


## Themed UI/UX, "juice" & random shit
- animation Pok√©mon evolve-like between two sprites when transitioning to gilet

- boire de la 86

- happy skin chemise hawaienne short tongs

- make units fatter by modifying X scale if they eat too much

- Guillotine to quit the game
