It was at this moment VikFro didn't know, he fucked up:

```# TODO: Finite State Machine?```

# Macaron Simulator (GMTK 2020 "Out of Control")
Simple RTS where your units have a hidden morale and hidden mechanics that impact it, which you have to figure out :)
 
Below certain thresholds the behaviour of the unit changes and it can start picking fights with its allies or destroy buildings etc.
 
=> The player loses the control you usually have in a RTS game, and has to adapt to the new configuration

# Adaptatation to submit Godot Wild Jam 23 "MiniWorld"
- more serious & less political theme? I don't know, like including a Macaron boss that you decapi...cut in half!
MACRABRON THE BOSS TO KILL WITH YOUR UNITS!
BE CAREFUL, HE TRANSFORMS YOUR UNITS BACK INTO WORKERS WITH HIS MONEY ATTACK!
- remove the "out of control-ness"
- link ends of screens horizontally and vertically (portals)


# Ideas

## TODO list
1. retransfo worker at 50 morale? (100?)
2. gain morale while fighting / getting thrown money at your face
3. flee AI when being beaten up / lose morale
4. JUICE or idle AI to be continued OR combat mechanic

4. morale out-of-control
    - fighting reduces it,
    - someone else harvesting food from the same machine as you reduces it

- enemy?

- NO multiple unit management! Because I don't have time and it's more "fun" to micromanage your baby units doing whatever they want

## Themed UI/UX, "juice" & random shit
- animation Pok√©mon evolve-like between two sprites when transitioning to gilet

- boire de la 86

- skin content chemise hawaienne short tongs

- make units fatter & slower by modifying X scale if they eat too much


# Technical / clean code stuff:
throw errors instead of print for bugs (null pointers)
