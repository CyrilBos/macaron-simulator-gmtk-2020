# Macron Simulator (GMTK 2020 "Out of Control" & Godot Wild Jam 23 "MiniWorld")
Simple RTS where your units have a hidden morale and hidden mechanics that impact it, which you have to figure out :)
 
Below certain thresholds the behaviour of the unit changes and it can start picking fights with its allies or destroy buildings etc.
 
=> The player loses the control you usually have in a RTS game, and has to adapt to the new configuration

# Ideas

## TODO list
- fix different units harvesting at the same time
- morale out-of-control
    - fighting reduces it,
    - someone else harvesting food from the same bush as you reduces it
- idle AI
- combat mechanic


- NO multiple unit management! Because I don't have time and it's more "fun" to micromanage your baby units doing whatever they want

## Themed UI/UX, "juice" & random shit
- YELLOW JACKET SKIN because LA GRÈVE on en a marre that the neighbour harvests the same bushes as us

- animation Pokémon evolve-like between two sprites 

- skin content chemise hawaienne short tongs

- Unit profile picture with **Pixel Art Jean Lasalle**

- make units fatter by modifying X scale if they eat too much

- The game can not be quit: There's a quit button but it trolls you
